<h2>Today</h2>
<p> Narrator: Now the Hundred Acre Wood boasted many natural wonders,
  but none was more beautiful than a tiny stream running through the forest.
  This particular stream had a very long way to travel and by the time
  it reached the edge of the forest, it had grown up so it was almost a river.
  "Being grown up," it said to itself, "there is no hurry.
  We shall get there someday." Now crossing the river,
  at its most peaceful spot, was an old wooden bridge.
  It was a familiar spot to Winnie the Pooh for he would often wander
  there doing nothing in particular, and thinking nothing in particular.
  But on the most recent of these excursions, something took
  his mind off of nothing.
  Pooh: Hmmm, this is a very good fur cone,
  and something ought to rhyme to it. Think,
  think think...Now, fur cones belong in trees,
  up high with the buzzing bees. But this one
  I found down on the ground, freed by a gentle breeeze!
  Oooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! Oh, bother.
  I suppose I shall have to find another one.
