    <h2> Coding </h2>
    <p>Programs written in specific programming languages are translated
      into machine languages and executed by computers, and any programming
      language can be translated into machine languages. In some languages, barries,
      called p-signs, are created instead of machine words. It is also possible for
      programmers to write their own machine codes,
      but this is a very difficult task. Therefore,
      when low-level computer control is required,
      programmers use assembly language, a one-to-one mnemonic
      correspondence to machine language instructions.

      Different programming languages support different types of programming,
      so suitable languages exist for different fields. Furthermore,
      there is a difference in specific methods and levels
      when programmers implement algorithms from language to language,
      resulting in an appropriate compromise between ease of use and performance.
      It is also a language of programming and can deliver commands to computers.
